# LTX Video Generator

A modern C# WPF application for generating videos using the LTX Video model. This application provides an intuitive interface to interact with the Lightricks LTX-Video model for creating videos from text prompts.

## Features

- **Modern WPF Interface**: Clean, professional UI with modern styling
- **LTX Video Model Integration**: Uses Python interop to run the LTX Video model
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor video generation progress
- **Generation History**: Keep track of previously generated videos
- **Flexible Parameters**: Control video duration, quality, dimensions, and more
- **File Management**: Easy browsing for model files and output directories

## Prerequisites

### .NET Requirements
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider (recommended)

### Python Requirements
- Python 3.9 or later
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for faster generation)
- At least 8GB VRAM for optimal performance

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python (Required)

Download and install Python 3.9 or later from [python.org](https://python.org). 
**Important**: Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### 2. Download the LTX Video Model

Download the LTX Video model from Hugging Face or the official Lightricks repository. The application expects:
- Model file: `ltxv-13b-0.9.7-distilled.safetensors`
- Default location: `D:\ai-models\Video\Lightbricks-LTX-Video\`

### 3. Build the Application

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd video_generator

# Restore NuGet packages
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

### 4. Run the Application

**Easy Way (Recommended):**
```bash
# Double-click run.bat or execute:
run.bat
```

**Manual Way:**
```bash
# Setup Python environment (first time only)
python src/python/setup_python.py

# Run the application
dotnet run --project src/VideoGenerator.UI
```

The application will automatically:
- Check if Python is installed
- Verify Python dependencies
- Set up the environment if needed
- Guide you through any missing requirements

## Usage

1. **Load Model**: 
   - Click "Browse..." to select your LTX Video model file
   - Click "Load Model" to initialize the model

2. **Configure Generation Parameters**:
   - **Prompt**: Enter your text description for the video
   - **Duration**: Set video length in seconds (1-30)
   - **Steps**: Number of inference steps (higher = better quality, slower)
   - **Guidance Scale**: Controls adherence to prompt (7.5 recommended)
   - **Dimensions**: Set width and height (512x512 recommended)
   - **FPS**: Frames per second for output video
   - **Seed**: Optional seed for reproducible results

3. **Generate Video**:
   - Click "Generate Video" to start the process
   - Monitor progress in the status panel
   - Cancel generation if needed

4. **View Results**:
   - Click "Open Last Video" to view the generated video
   - Click "Open Output Folder" to browse all generated videos
   - Check generation history in the right panel

## Architecture

The application follows clean architecture principles with dependency injection:

```
├── VideoGenerator.Core/          # Domain models and interfaces
├── VideoGenerator.Services/      # Python interop and business logic
├── VideoGenerator.UI/           # WPF presentation layer
│   ├── ViewModels/             # MVVM view models
│   ├── Styles/                 # UI styling and themes
│   └── Converters/             # Data binding converters
└── python/                      # Python scripts and environment
    ├── ltx_video_generator.py  # Main video generation script
    └── setup_python.py        # Environment setup script
```

### Key Components

- **IVideoGenerationService**: Interface for video generation operations
- **PythonVideoGenerationService**: Implements video generation via Python subprocess
- **IPythonEnvironmentService**: Manages Python environment setup and validation
- **MainWindowViewModel**: MVVM view model with reactive properties
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- **Modular Python Scripts**: Separate Python files for video generation and setup

## Configuration

### Model Path
The application defaults to:
```
D:\ai-models\Video\Lightbricks-LTX-Video\ltxv-13b-0.9.7-distilled.safetensors
```

You can change this path in the UI or modify the default in `MainWindowViewModel.cs`.

### Output Directory
Videos are saved to the same directory as the model by default. You can specify a different output directory in the UI.

## Performance Tips

1. **GPU Acceleration**: Ensure CUDA is properly installed for GPU acceleration
2. **VRAM Usage**: Monitor GPU memory usage; reduce batch size if needed
3. **Storage**: Ensure sufficient disk space for generated videos
4. **Steps vs Speed**: Lower step counts generate faster but may reduce quality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model Loading Fails**:
- Verify the model file path is correct
- Ensure the model file is not corrupted
- Check Python dependencies are installed

**Generation Fails**:
- Verify Python is in your system PATH
- Check CUDA installation if using GPU
- Monitor system resources (RAM, VRAM, disk space)

**Python Process Errors**:
- Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r python_requirements.txt`
- Verify Python version compatibility (3.9+)
- Check firewall/antivirus settings

### Logs
The application logs to the console. Check the output window in your IDE or run from command line to see detailed logs.
